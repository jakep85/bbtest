      There are a number of ways to do icons. Looks like the main BB uses inline SVG with CSS to control fill.
      Could process them all with iconmoon and make icon font or create some Ligature icons eg. <i class="bb-icon-wifi"></i>
      If inline SVG we can change color like below.
      NPM package can combine SVGs from a folder into SVG sprite with <use>, but a bit more limited on CSS control
      
      Added width and height here and svg to fill below because looks like Figma clock linked to 32x32 icon SVG
      Yes could adjust the width and height in SVG markup manually, but if this is missed then icons in this
      component are not consistant.

      A few different ways to handle this.
        - Have a utility class for margin right add to markup eg. "bb-u-margin-right-xxs"
        - Since this icon is modified could use BEM modifier up in the common area above 
          and use "&--details" to create a class like "bb-card__icon--details" to add to the markup
        - Make the icon 'self aware' by putting ".bb-card__details-item & { spacing here }" this
          would mean whenever the icon has a parent class of above, it would add extra spacing
        - Decided to go with below approach to keep everything relating to the details section in the
          one spot and easier to read/manage
